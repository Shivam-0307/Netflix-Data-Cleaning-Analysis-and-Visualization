4: Data Cleaning Using SQL Queries
    Handling Missing Values.
      â€¢	Standardized date formats for consistency.
                    SQL Query:
                    CREATE TABLE netflix_cleaned AS
                    SELECT
                        show_id,
                        type,
                        title,
                        director,
                        country,
                        STR_TO_DATE(date_added, '%m/%d/%Y') AS date_added,
                        release_year,
                        rating,
                        Coalesce(CASE
                                    WHEN duration LIKE '%min' THEN    
                                    CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, ' ', 1) AS UNSIGNED)
                                    ELSE NULL
                                 END, 0) AS duration_min,
                        Coalesce(CASE
                                    WHEN duration LIKE '%Season%' THEN 
                                    CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, ' ', 1) AS UNSIGNED)
                                	  ELSE NULL
                        	    	END,0) AS num_seasons,
                        listed_in
                    FROM netflix1;

5: Checking for Duplicate Values
    Finding Duplicate Entries
        SQL Query:
                  SELECT show_id, title, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
                  FROM netflix_cleaned
                  GROUP BY show_id, title
                  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
â€¢	No duplicate records were found in the dataset.

                ORDER BY total_shows DESC
                LIMIT 10;
    Most Popular Genres
                SELECT listed_in, COUNT(*) AS genre_count

                ORDER BY genre_count DESC
                LIMIT 10;
    Trend of New Content Over the Years
                SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS total_releases
                FROM netflix_cleaned
                GROUP BY release_year
                ORDER BY release_year ASC;
    Average Movie Duration
                SELECT ROUND(AVG(duration_min), 2) AS avg_movie_duration
                FROM netflix_cleaned
                WHERE type = 'Movie';
